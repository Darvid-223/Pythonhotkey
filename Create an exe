1. Install `pyinstaller` (if you haven't already) to create an executable from your Python script:

pip install pyinstaller

2. Create an executable from your Python script (replace `your_script.py` with the name of your script):

pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py

This command will create a standalone executable in the `dist` folder.

3. Move the executable to a suitable location, e.g., `/home/darvid/python/`:

sudo mv dist/your_script /home/darvid/python/

4. Create a systemd service file for your script. Create a new file called `your_script.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/`:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/your_script.service

5. Add the following content to the file (replace `your_script` with the name of your executable):

[Unit]
Description=Your script description

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/darvid/python/your_script
Restart=always
User=darvid
Environment=DISPLAY=:0

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

6. Save the file and exit the text editor.
7. Enable and start the service:

sudo systemctl enable your_script.service
sudo systemctl start your_script.service

Your script will now run in the background, and it will automatically start whenever your computer starts. You can check the status of your script with:

sudo systemctl status your_script.service

If you want to stop the script, use:

sudo systemctl stop your_script.service
